Django REST framework is a powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs.

Some reasons you might want to use REST framework:

The Web browsable API is a huge usability win for your developers.
Authentication policies including optional packages for OAuth1a and OAuth2.
Serialization that supports both ORM and non-ORM data sources.
Customizable all the way down - just use regular function-based views if you don't need the more powerful features.
Extensive documentation, and great community support.
There is a live example API for testing purposes, available here.
